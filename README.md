This is the frontend of the Destiny 2 Stat Tracker created using React. This is the link to the backend: https://github.com/AndretheG/Destiny-Stat-Tracker-Backend

All data used on the page was sourced from the Bungie API: https://bungie-net.github.io

This is my first MAJOR full stack coding project and I am proud of how it turned out despite those long load times 

(see, it's just like playing Destiny). The Stats rendered come from all activities across the game and are presented in a wonderfully

aesthetic fashion. Upon authorizing with Bungie.net, users are directed to the webpage where they can scroll through over 200 different

stats for their Destiny 2 account. Please enjoy. Feedback is welcomed. The frontend here was created using React through Create React App and the backend was 

created using NodeJs, RedisStore, and PostgreSQL
